                <p><strong>What is git?</strong> Refer from <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git-scm website</a>, is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>
                <p>If I tell you more about other topics about git and its mechanism or features, you will be overwhelmed and afraid to continue, I will show you how to <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">download</a> and install git on your system instead.</p>
                <p>I assumed you already downloaded the git, just open the installer and choose Next until the installation finished. Then check the installation existed by opening up Terminal (Linux and MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Windows:</strong> pressing <kbd>Win+R</kbd> button to open "Run" window, then type <var>cmd</var> to open Command Prompt window</li>

                    Using git can be done on local and remote, initializing on local environment is called local repository,
                    repository is a whole git environment for your entire project that contains all your project files and directories.
                </p>
                <p>To use git right away, you need to make git environment on a folder/directory. Initialize it by using these commands on your preferred Terminal:</p>

                <pre><code>cd /path/to/project/directory
git init</code></pre>
    
                <p>Creating empty repository will generate these files and is recognized by git:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><var>.git</var> directory, this file represents local repository head file, by default this is hidden, if this file is modified or deleted, then this local repository is no longer recognized by git</li>
                    <li><var>.gitignore</var> file, this is a file that excludes file and directory listed inside here</li>
                    <li><var>README.MD</var> file, this is a readme file that can be used on GitHub repository landing page</li>

            <article>
                <p>To initialize git repository until commiting to local repository (continuing from Setup section), use these commands in order:</p>
    
                <pre><code>cd /path/to/project/directory
git init
git add .
git commit</code></pre>
    
                <p>Here is the rundown of commands:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Head to your project directory</li>
                    <li>Initialize an empty git repository</li>
                    <li>Between this commands, you can work on your project by add and edit files to be commited later as your project save checkpoint</li>
                    <li>Add all (using "." sign) existing files into staging area (more on that later)</li>
                    <li>Commit your staged files into your local git repository</li>

                    There are two environments of git, local and remote repository,
                    <strong>local</strong> can be used for local repository while <strong>remote</strong>
                    is a hosted repository than can be accessed over internet.
                </p>
                <p>Here are the advantages of local repository:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Can only be accessed on local such as LAN and above connection (except over internet) so
                        the repository is more private
                    </li>
                    <li>Removes the need of hosting</li>
                    <li>Removes the need of internet connection</li>
                    <li>Avoid network issues</li>
                    <li>Removes the need of backup files, act as an save and checkpoints 
                        in case of messed up project you can go back to previous checkpoint
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>And here are the advantages of remote repository:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Easy cross platform access of projects</li>
                    <li>Enabling collaboration</li>
                    <li>Project visibility</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istamosh/responsive-web-design/master/technical-documentation-page/src/github-clone.jpg" alt="cloning the git repository">

                <p>Let's assume you already make git repository hosted on GitHub and copied the remote address
                    like the above picture. Continuing from last commit commands, 
                    here is the command for pushing local commit into newly created 
                    remote repository on GitHub as example. Depending on your working branch name,
                    in this case it is on "master" branch, so the commands are:
                </p>

                <pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/my-username/repository-name.git
git push -u origin master</code></pre>

                <p>Everytime you are done on local commits and want to push your commits 
                    into GitHub remote repository you need to type this in Terminal:
                </p>
                
                <pre><code>git push -u origin master</code></pre>

            <article>
                <p>Need to experiment something or adding a feature on your project and 
                    don't want to mess up existing project? git provides branching 
                    for your needs, branching is done locally by using this command and 
                    switch to your desired branch name:
                </p>
    
                <pre><code>git checkout -b your-branch-name
git checkout your-branch-name</code></pre>

                <p>If you want to switch back to <em>main</em> branch:</p>

                <pre><code>git checkout main</code></pre>

                <p>You might want to work on your project and make changes, then commit 
                    your changes on local branch, in case if you forget how to commit you can go <a href="#Commands">back to Commands section.</a> 
                    Then if you are done on local and want to push into remote with that feature branch, 
                    you can do this on Terminal:
                </p>
                
                <pre><code>git push -u origin your-branch-name-same-as-local</code></pre>

                <p>The code right before this is done one time only, 
                    the next time you want to push your commited changes on local 
                    you can do this instead:
                </p>

                <pre><code>git push</code></pre>

                <p>
                    Here are the benefits of branching:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Uninterrupted works and commits while on collaboration with others</li>
                    <li>Does not interrupt the main branch of the project, usually when it is live</li>
                    <li>Easily track any changes and manages versions</li>

                <p>If you are working on remote repository too and need to maintain 
                    your local in sync with remote, you need two commands called 
                    git pull and push. But first update your current local branch 
                    so you know if your local branch is already in sync or behind 
                    from your remote branch, and check your status afterwards.
                </p>

                <pre><code>git remote update
git status</code></pre>

                <p>
                    These are the definition of git pull and git push, so you know 
                    what to do next.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pull:</strong> an act of pulling updates from remote into 
                    your local repository, this happens if your local is behind your remote, 
                    if you invoke this command and your local is already in sync, then the 
                    message shows "already up to date"</li>
                    <li><strong>Push:</strong> an act of pushing your local changes into remote, 
                    will make a checkpoint of your local to remote, this happens everytime you commit 
                    your changes on your local project</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If your local branch commits are behind remote branch commits, do this command everytime after <code>git remote update</code>:
                </p>

                <pre><code>git pull</code></pre>

                <p>If your local is ahead of remote (after commit have been done), do this command everytime you want to push your commit into remote:</p>

                <pre><code>git push</code></pre>

                <p>Now you can check your commit log by using this command (after that, quit by pressing <kbd>q</kbd> on your keyboard):</p>

                <pre><code>git log --oneline</code></pre>

            <p>
                Oolong tea or "dark dragon" tea, is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced through a process that includes withering the leaves under strong sun and allowing some oxidation to occur before curling and twisting. 
                Oolong is especially popular in southeastern China and among ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia, different styles of oolong tea can vary widely in flavor. They can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas, woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and fresh with complex aromas, all depending on the horticulture and style of production.

            <p>
                Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process which is used to make oolong teas and black teas. Green tea originated in China, and since then its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia. 
                Green tea is prepared by steaming and pan-frying the leaves and then drying them.

            <p>
                Black tea also is called "red tea" is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than other teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis, though Camellia taliensis is also used rarely. 
                While green tea usually loses its flavour within a year, black tea retains its flavour for several years.
